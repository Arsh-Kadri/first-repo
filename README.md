My ideal super power would be to able to read minds because it would give me the ability to accomplish whatever I would want in all aspects of life. For example, I could be the greatest at most sports because I would be able to predict what my opponent or defender would do and therefore counter accordingly. I could use this same concept for videogames specifically among us. I would also be able to obtain any job or anything I want by sweet-talking the other person.
